                This website serves as my official co-op work term report for the <strong>Fall 2025</strong> term at the University of Guelph.
                My goal is to provide readers with a <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>honest</strong>, and <strong>engaging</strong> account of
                what I learned, how I grew, and what it means to work with <strong>real-world data</strong> in a professional
                <strong>Salesforce consulting</strong> environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                I completed my work term at <strong>Momentum Worldwide</strong>, where I worked remotely in a hybrid-optional role as a
                <strong>Data Analyst</strong>. My term began on <strong>August 25th</strong> and focused on preparing, transforming, validating,
                and importing client data from <strong>legacy CRM systems</strong> into <strong>Salesforce</strong>. Through this experience,
                I gained hands-on exposure to <strong>data migration workflows</strong>, Salesforce’s <strong>data model</strong>, and the importance
                of <strong>clean, well-structured information</strong> in real business and nonprofit contexts.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-0">
                I hope readers come away from this report with an understanding of how <strong>technical skills</strong>,
                <strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>quantitative reasoning</strong> intersect in industry—and how much growth can happen
                when theory meets practice. I also gained exposure to professional workflow tools used in many workplaces, including
                <strong>Jira</strong> for tracking tasks and project progress, and <strong>Clockify</strong> for work-hour reporting and accountability.

                <strong>Momentum Worldwide</strong> is a <strong>Salesforce consulting firm</strong> that specializes in designing, implementing,
                and supporting customized Salesforce solutions for a variety of clients. Their work spans <strong>data migration</strong>,
                <strong>system integration</strong>, <strong>analytics</strong>, <strong>automation</strong>, and long-term platform optimization.
              </p>

              <p>
                Operating within the Salesforce ecosystem places Momentum at the intersection of several computer science domains, including
                <strong>cloud computing</strong>, <strong>data engineering</strong>, <strong>AI-driven analytics</strong>, and
                <strong>systems integration</strong>. Their toolset includes technologies such as <strong>Salesforce Data Cloud</strong>,
                <strong>Einstein AI</strong>, <strong>MuleSoft</strong>, and <strong>Tableau</strong>, all of which rely on robust back-end data
                pipelines and sophisticated system architecture.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-0">
                Based in <strong>Toronto, Ontario</strong>, Momentum is a small but highly specialized team of approximately <strong>20 people</strong>.
                This size creates a <strong>collaborative environment</strong> where junior team members are exposed to real client work early on.
                The company’s services include custom Salesforce implementations, migration from legacy CRMs, analytics solutions, and ongoing training
                and support. What stood out most to me was how deeply <strong>technical accuracy</strong> and <strong>human communication</strong>
                were intertwined—clean data only matters if people can understand and use it. On the delivery side, tasks were often structured and
                tracked through <strong>Jira</strong>, and time was reported through <strong>Clockify</strong>, both of which reinforced professional
                project discipline.

          <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">What were your goals / learning outcomes for this work term?</h5>
          <p class="mb-2">My primary learning goals were:</p>

          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Communication:</strong>
              Develop the ability to explain complex data findings, Salesforce data relationships, and technical processes clearly and confidently
              to both technical and non-technical audiences.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Salesforce CRM Mastery:</strong>
              Build a strong working knowledge of Salesforce—specifically the <strong>Account</strong>, <strong>Contact</strong>, and <strong>Gift</strong>
              data models—to design, validate, and implement clean data integrations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quantitative Literacy:</strong>
              Enhance my ability to interpret, analyze, and present quantitative information using <strong>Excel</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and
              <strong>Python</strong> to support data-driven decision-making.

              <h5 class="fw-bold">Did you develop goals relating to your job tasks?</h5>
              <p class="mb-0">
                Yes. Each of these goals directly reflected the real expectations of my role. My work required me to explain technical decisions
                to clients, manipulate large datasets responsibly, and understand how Salesforce structures relationships between objects. Rather
                than being abstract, these goals were tied to daily responsibilities. Keeping tasks updated in <strong>Jira</strong> helped ensure
                my day-to-day work stayed aligned with project priorities and deadlines.

              <h5 class="fw-bold">What skills did you want to learn? How will these benefit your next work experience?</h5>
              <p>
                This work term helped me develop both <strong>technical</strong> and <strong>professional</strong> skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the technical side, I strengthened my ability to <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>validate</strong>, and <strong>transform</strong>
                messy real-world datasets. I learned how CRM systems structure information, how migrations are planned, and how errors propagate if left unchecked.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                On the professional side, I learned how to communicate clearly, ask better questions, document my work, and operate independently. I also
                learned how to receive feedback constructively and adapt quickly. These skills will directly benefit my next work experience by allowing me to
                onboard faster, communicate more confidently, and contribute meaningfully from the start. Accurate time logging through <strong>Clockify</strong>
                also helped me build a habit of accountability and better estimation for similar tasks in the future.

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">What technologies did you want to work with and why?</h5>
              <p>
                I was particularly interested in working with <strong>Salesforce</strong> because I wanted to understand why CRM platforms are so central
                to modern organizations. Cloud-based systems, customer data pipelines, and large-scale automation were all unfamiliar to me before this role.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                Rather than choosing Salesforce because it is popular, I chose it because it was unknown. I wanted to understand how real companies store, move,
                and use data—and how mistakes in these systems can have real consequences. Momentum gave me the opportunity to see how Salesforce is actually used
                in practice, not just in theory. I also gained exposure to how teams operate in practice—planning and tracking work in <strong>Jira</strong> and
                recording effort accurately with <strong>Clockify</strong>.

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Reflecting on your goals, what goals did you complete?</h5>
              <p class="mb-2">I successfully completed all three learning goals.</p>
              <ul class="mb-0">
                <li>I became more confident in communicating technical information.</li>
                <li>I developed a strong practical understanding of Salesforce’s data model.</li>
                <li>I became more comfortable working with large datasets using Excel, SQL, and Python.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mt-3 mb-0">
                Some goals were achieved more deeply than others, but each one showed measurable growth. Maintaining clear progress updates in <strong>Jira</strong>
                and tracking hours in <strong>Clockify</strong> helped reinforce consistency, planning, and professional accountability.

              <p class="mb-0">
                While I met my goals overall, I did not engage as deeply with formal <strong>Salesforce Trailhead</strong> modules as originally planned.
                This was primarily due to time constraints and the fact that hands-on project work became my main learning method. Instead of structured modules,
                I learned through direct application, documentation, and problem-solving. Although this diverged from my original plan, it ultimately resulted in
                deeper practical understanding.

              <p>
                My role at <strong>Momentum Worldwide</strong> was <strong>Data Analyst</strong>, with a focus on <strong>data migration</strong> and
                <strong>quality assurance</strong> for Salesforce implementations.
              </p>

              <p>
                I worked with client datasets extracted from legacy CRMs. These datasets were often inconsistent, incomplete, or incorrectly formatted.
                My job was to clean, restructure, validate, and prepare this data so it could be safely imported into Salesforce without breaking relationships
                between objects.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-2">Some of the most interesting aspects of my job included:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Designing mappings</strong> between old and new systems</li>
                <li>Creating <strong>deduplication logic</strong></li>
                <li>Detecting <strong>structural inconsistencies</strong></li>
                <li>Troubleshooting <strong>import errors</strong></li>
                <li>Writing <strong>Python scripts</strong> for automated quality checks</li>
                <li>Using <strong>SQL</strong> to validate record relationships</li>
                <li>Communicating findings to teammates and clients</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="mb-0">
                Most of these skills were learned on the job. While my coursework gave me foundational exposure to databases and programming, this role taught me
                how those skills are used in real production environments. Tasks were often broken down and tracked in <strong>Jira</strong>, which helped make
                priorities and blockers visible, and work hours were recorded through <strong>Clockify</strong>, reinforcing real-world consulting habits.

                If someone were asked to describe this website, I would want them to say that it demonstrates growth—technically, professionally, and personally.
              </p>

              <p>
                This work term taught me that data is not just numbers in a spreadsheet. It represents people, transactions, histories, and relationships.
                Mistakes matter. Clarity matters. Communication matters.
              </p>

              <p>
                Momentum helped me understand what it means to be responsible for data that real organizations depend on. I learned to slow down, verify assumptions,
                and think critically about every transformation I made.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-0">
                More than anything, this experience gave me confidence that I can contribute meaningfully in technical environments—and that learning does not stop when
                the code runs successfully. I also gained practical experience with how teams stay organized and accountable in professional settings, using tools like
                <strong>Jira</strong> for coordination and <strong>Clockify</strong> for accurate reporting.

                I would like to thank my supervisor, Matthew Skogstad-Stubbs, and the Momentum Worldwide team for their patience, guidance, and trust throughout this term. Their willingness
                to answer questions, explain decisions, and let me take ownership of real tasks made this experience incredibly valuable.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-0">
                I am especially grateful for the mentorship I received during my early weeks of shadowing. That foundation allowed me to grow into a more independent
                and confident contributor by the end of the term.
